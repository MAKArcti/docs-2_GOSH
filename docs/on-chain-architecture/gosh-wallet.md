# GOSH Wallet

GOSH exists on-chain as a system of interconnected smart contracts. Every repository, every file and commit are smart contracts, where data is written to the blockchain.

Writing data to the blockchain requires cryptographic signatures and fees.

For this reason every GOSH user needs to have a wallet and a pair of cryptographic keys.

GOSH wallets are specially written to facilitate open-source development - following certain rules  the GOSH blockchain giver will fund all actions in an open-source repository, and development will be free.

Refer to [GOSH Web](../working-with-gosh/gosh-web.md) or [Docker Extension](../working-with-gosh/docker-extension.md) sections to find out how to create your wallet and get started with GOSH, depending on where you're coming to GOSH from.
