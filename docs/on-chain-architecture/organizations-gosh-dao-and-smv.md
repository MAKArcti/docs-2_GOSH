# Organizations: GOSH DAO and SMV

## **DAO**


Every repository on [GOSH](../working-with-gosh/gosh-web.md#create-account) is managed as a [**Decentralized Autonomous Organization** - DAO](../working-with-gosh/gosh-web.md#create-organization-dao) â€“ a tool that allows every developer to build on GOSH in a way that is decentralized, secure, and scalable.

Every organization has, as a minimum, one member who [creates and manages repositories](../working-with-gosh/gosh-web.md#working-with-repository). However, once more than one [user is added to a DAO](../working-with-gosh/gosh-web.md#add-members-to-dao), it is then governed through decentralized management mechanisms.

Your can [configure](../working-with-gosh/gosh-web.md#dao-set-up) your DAO easily.

The main of these mechanisms is voting. Any action in a DAO requires a vote and is created through a [proposals](../working-with-gosh/gosh-web.md#proposals-and-voting-in-smv-soft-majority-vote). For example, a user may propose to [commit of file](../working-with-gosh/gosh-web.md#create-file) into a repository, and a soft-majority vote (SMV) of all other DAO members may be required to approve it. [Branches](../working-with-gosh/gosh-web.md#create-branch) could be locked to require any changes to them to be voted on by DAO SMV.


## **Soft Majority Voting**


Soft Majority Voting, or SMV for short, is a voting mechanism designed for transparency and optional participation.

The outcome of an SMV vote is decided by the difference between the number of votes for, and the number of votes against a proposal. If nobody objects, a minimum threshold of approving votes is required for the proposal to pass.

If everyone votes either for or against a proposal, 50% + 1 vote is required for the proposal to pass.

If the only votes given are for the proposal, and no one votes against, 10% approving votes are enough for the proposal to pass.

Everything in between these two extremes is a linear dependency between the percentage of votes against and percentage of votes for required to pass the proposal.

For important decisions a more strict super majority approval criteria may be set up.

All SMV proposals have a set deadline. When it is reached, accumulated votes are counted, the decision is made, and the proposal completes.

If however a majority of 50% + 1 vote is achieved early, the proposal completes immediately.


## **SMV in GOSH**


In GOSH one vote is one token.

### **Tokens and Karma**

The total supply of tokens is set when a DAO is created.

A DAO's first user automatically gets 20 DAO tokens and 20 Karma.

**Karma** is the amount of tokens (upper limit) within which a DAO member can vote.

Karma is either granted by a DAO decision upon member acceptance or earned through repository contribution.
This determines the reputation of the DAO member. The Karma can be changed only by voting.

See [here](../working-with-gosh/gosh-web.md#overview-of-the-dao) for more information.

### **Voting**

For a proposal in GOSH to pass early several participants need to vote for it with 50% of the Global Karma Count of the DAO + 1 token.

**Global Karma Count** is the total amount of Karma calculated by summing up the Karma of all DAO members at the time of the proposal creation.

If no one objects to a proposal for the duration of its voting period, 10% f the Global Karma Count is enough, but the proposal will only complete at the end of the voting period.

If votes are split, and neither side achieves 50% + 1 token early, the proposal completes at the end of the voting period and the result is calculated according to the diagram above.
